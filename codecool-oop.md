# OOP Basics with Java questions

## Java ecosystem

What is the JVM?
  - JVM is Java Virtual Machine
  - It is an abstract machine, which can provide runtime environment for java programs to convert bytecodes to machine codes
  - It provides Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
  - The implementation and algorithms are not specified, other companies have created its virtual machines (Oracle, stb..)
  - Peovides: 
    - Loads code
    - Verifies code
    - Executes code
    - Provides runtime environment
    

What does Java compilation mean?
  - Java uses a two steps compilation method, in which first it uses an OS independent compilation and after that the second compilatio happens in the JVM, which custom built for the OS
  - Java dont compile to executable files, instead it compiles to object codes
  - First it compiles to bytecode
  - Then the JVM interperate the bytecode into the specific computers machine code


What is Java bytecode?
  - Java bytecode is the instruction set of the JVM for executing programs written
  - It enables Java programs to be platform-independent
  - Intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code
    
What is the difference between the JRE and the JDK?
  - JRE: 
    - Java Runtime Environment is a software that java programs require to run
    - It communicates between the java program and the operating system
    - It is like a translator, which provides resources, so the program can run on any OS
  - JDK: 
    - Java Development Kit is development environment
    - It offers developer tools, libraries that are neccesarry to develop java based software
  - Difference: 
    - JRE is the on disk part of java that creates the bytecodes and compiles and setting up the JVM
    - JDK is a tool that can be used when you write code, it's provides libraries and other tools to develop programs

What is the `Iterable` interface?
  - In java an Iterable is an interface
  - Each object that implements the iterable interface are allowed to iterate over somehow
  - You can iterate over the object with a for loop, for-each loop or by using the iterable interfaces methods
  - Example using iterator interface:
    ```java
      List<Integer> nums = List.of(1,2,3,4,5);
      Iterator<Integer> iterator = nums.iterator();
      while(iterator.hasNext()){
          System.out.println(iterator.next());
      }
    ```

What is the `Collection` interface?
  - The collection interface is a member of the collection framework
  - It is the root interface of the Collection framework
  - It is implements the Iterable interface
  - It has core methods that are not been implemented like: add, addAll, clear, contains, isEmpty, etc...
  - Other mebers of the collection frameworks implementing the Collection interface
  - The interface is not directly implemented in the sub interfaces
  - Sub interfaces: List, Set, Queue

What is the `Map` interface?
  - The Map interface is not part of the Collections framework in java
  - It can be categorised as a separate framework
  - It represents a mapping between key-value pairs
  - It stores the data a key-value pair manner
  - Map contains unique keys
  - They performed to do look ups by the keys
  - It has core methods that can be implemented by sub interfaces like: clear, containsKey, containsValue, entrySet (Creates a set view of the map), isEmpty, size, values, put(Needs a key and a value), get(needs a key to return the specific data)
  - Implementations: HashTable, HashMap, SortedMap(Interface)

Compare sets, lists, and queues in Java.
  - Set: 
    - Is a data structure that stores unique datas (mainly unordered)
    - It doesn't allow duplication of an element
    - Because it is not ordered it cannot be accessed with an index
    - It is part of the Collection framework
    - Implementations: 
      - HashSet (It uses a HashTable, each element is stored in a bucket based on it's has, so it is not unordered and guranteed to return the elements in the same order as before)
      - TreeSet: (It uses a binary tree to represent each element in the set)
      - LinkedHashSet: (It is uses a hashTable and a LinkedList to store the data)
    - Time complexity for major operations: 
      - insertion: O(1)
      - finding: O(n)
      - deleting: O(1)
      - empty: O(1)
      - containing: O(1)
    - Important methods: add, clear, contains, remove, isempty
  - List: 
    - Is a data structure that stores the elements in an ordered manner
    - It is easier and faster to retreive and delete data in a specific index
    - It allows repetition
    - Lists are dynamic sized
    - It is similar to an array
    - The two major implementation of the list interface are: ArrayList and Linked List
    - Important methods: add, addAll, of, clear, contains, get, size, indexOf, isEmpty, lastIndexOf, remove, toArray, sort
  - Queue: 
    - Is a linear data type, which is opened at both ends
    - It performs the operations in FIFO order (First In First Out)
    - All adition is made at one end (Enqueing)
    - All deletion is made at the other end (Dequeing)
    - It is like a line that purchase a ticket
    - We can access both ends
    - At insertion we only appending to the end of the queue
    - At deletion/retreival we only accessing the beginning of the queue
    - Implementations: LinkedList, PriorityQueue
    - Important methods: offer, pull, peak

Compare `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java.
  - ArrayList: 
    - It is a resizable array data structure that implements the List interface
    - They store elements in a sequence of order 
    - It size can be increased or decreased by adding and removing
    - It is like cubes next to each other
    - It stores the elements indexes
    - Time complexity: 
      - retreival: O(1) (by there index)
      - adding: O(n) (if you want to insert an element to the middle or you want to extend the list and add new element)
      - deleting: O(n) (because you have to shift every element)
  - LinkedList: 
    - In java it is a doubly LinkedList that implements the dequeue and list interface
    - Store elements in sequential order
    - Each element is associated with a node
    - Every node has two field that points to the previous and next node (to the neighbors or the next elements)
    - It doesn't store indexes
    - Time complexity: 
      - retreival: O(n) (You have to start from the beginning and triverse the whole list until you found the element)
      - adding: O(1) to the front and back O(n) if you want to insert in the middle
      - deleteing: O(1) if you want to delete from the beginning or from the end
    - Both of them are implementing the List interface
    - But the difference is between, how the implement the methods
    - In arrayLists the retrevial of a data is much faster than in the linked list
    - But in a linkedList the adding elements to the middle or deleting an element from the middle is much faster than in the arrayList

Are sets sorted in Java?
  - It depend on the implementation
  - If We use the LinkedHasSet, than it is sorted

## Language features

What control statements are available in Java?
  - Java control statements:
    - Decesion making statements: 
      - if statements
      - switch statement
    - Loop statements: 
      - do while
      - while loop
      - for loop
      - for-each loop
    - Jump statements: 
      - break
      - continue statement
        
Compare the different looping constructs in Java.
  - while loop: 
    - The while loop is repeating the program that is inside of the block scope until the statement is true
    - You have to tell a statement in the beginning to stop the repeating of it
    - If you don't have a statement on when should it stop you will create an infinit loop (If you want to iterate a specifide times you should create a variable outsude of the loop and you have to increase it at the end of each iteration)

    ```java
      int i = 0;
      while(i < 5){
          System.out.println("Hello, world!");
          i++;
      }
    ```

  - do while:
    - The do while loop is working like the wile loop
    - It is checking the statement and it will run untill it is true
    - But the difference is that it will always run the code at least one time and after that it will evaluate the statement
    - So it will automatically run the loop one time and after the first cycle it will check the statement

    ```java
      int i = 0;
      do{
          System.out.println("Hello, world!");
          i++;
      }while(i < 5);
    ```    

  - for loop: 
    - The for loop is specific loop
    - It is set up to repeat the code x-amount of time
    - It is designed where you have to give a starting number, you have to add the condition (When should it stop) and increasing the iteration count, to fullfill the condition that has been set
    - It is specified to go through an array or a list (collection)
    - It is counting the steps that has been done and it will stop if it reached the step that has been specified in the condition part
    - You can use the count for indexing in a array or collection

    ```java
      int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4};
      for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
          System.out.println(numbers[i]);
      }
    ```

  - for-each loop:
    - The for each loop is the simplified for loop which
    - It is created to go through from the beginning to the end of a collection or array
    - You can't stop through the loop, because it is going through from the beginning to the end
    - You can't use indexes, because it doesn't specifies it
    - you most likely to use this if you want to go through a collection

    ```java
      List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1,2,3,4,5);
      for(int num : numbers){
          System.out.println(num);
      }
    ```

Compare the different conditional constructs in Java.
  - In java there is 3 conditional statements (if-else, switch, ternary)
  - if-else: 
    - Inside of the if part there is bracket where you can put your statement
    - If the given statement is true then it will run the code inside the block after the if statement
    - The else statement has no brackets that accepts a condition
    - It will automatically run when the statement at the if part is false
    - Also there is a else if part where you give other specific cases like in the if part, but it will only run after the main if part

    ```java
      if(a % 2 == 0){
          System.out.println("The number is even!");
      } else if(a == 1){
          System.out.println("The number is one!");
      } else{
          System.out.println("The number is odd!");
      }
    ```


What is a `while` loop?
  - A While Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met
  - It is one of the oldest looping construct
  - Ther has to be a condition on when should it stop, because it can create an infinit loop

  ```java
    int i = 0;
    while(i < 5){
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        i++;
    }
  ```

How do you manually break out of a loop?

    - You can manually break the loop with the break keyword or using the continue operator

    e.g.: for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            if(i == 7){
                System.out.println("The number is 7");
                break;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
         }

        output: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, The number is 7

    e.g.: for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            if(i == 7){
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
          }


        output: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9

    
- What does the `var` keyword mean?

    - The var keyword allowes you to declare a variable without specifying the type
    - This feature is known as type inference

    e.g.: var age = 19;
          var name = "Patrik";
          var favouriteColor = Colors.GREEN;


- What are _lambda expressions_? How are they used in Java development?

    - Lambda expressions are a block of code which takes a parameter and returns a value
    - They are simular to methods
    - They don't require a name like the methods and they can be implemented right at the body of a method
    - You can use lambda expressions if the class or interface is a functional interface (It only has one abstract method only)
    - Lambda expressions can be stored in a variable and they are usually passed into as a parameter of a method (e.g: foreach)
    - Also to store the lambda expression you can use the Consumer interface
    - Most lamda expressions are accepting a parameters and returns an expression
        
        parameter -> expression
        (parameter1, parameter2) -> {core block}


    - They can't contain variables, assignments and statements (if, for)
    - If the expression is more complex you can use curly braces {}, in this case you need to use a return 
    - Most cases we use lambda expressions in streams

## Type system

- What are primitive types in Java? Give some examples.

    - Primitive types are the most basic data types avaible within java
    - These are the building blocks of data manipulation
    - Primitive types: - boolean
                       - char
                       - byte
                       - int
                       - double
                       - float
                       - long
                       - short


- What is the difference between primitive types and reference types?

    - Primitive: - There is only 8 primitive types in java
                 - They built into the language sytax and uses keywords
                 - Primitives stores the actual values
                 - Primitives are stored in the stack memory
                 - When assiging a primitive value to a variable we copy the value to the variable
                 - We can compare primitive types with the == sign



    - Reference: - Reference types are not provided by default
                 - You can create your own type
                 - We can create reference types with the new keyword (instentiation)
                 - When we use the new keyword the memory will allocate space to the variable
                 - Reference types are storing a memory address (refference) where the data is located
                 - A reference type can be a complex structure that includes other data types
                 - Reference types are stored in the heap memory
                 - When assiging a reference value to a variable we copy the memory address (refference) to the variable
                 (- So we can have two variables that are pointing to the same memory spot and overwrite the data)
                 - We can't use the == sign to compare reference types, becase then we compare the two memory addresses.
                   Insted we are using the .equals() method to check the values of a reference type


- What is a class in Java?
    
    - A class hase some common properties and methods
    - A class is like a blueprint for the objects, how should they look like or what should they do
    - It is like a constructor, where you can create objects from with the set properties, atributes and methods
    - From the classes you can instantiate different objects that has the some fields and methods
    - It is a logical entity


    e.g: class Dog{
            private final String name;
            private int age;
            private final String breed;

            //constructor
        }


- What is an object in Java?

    - In java everything is associated as an object
    - An object represents an entity
    - An object is an instance of a class
    - It is a copy of a special class
    - It will have the same fields and methods as the class, but it can have different values for each instance of the class
    - You can create an object from a class by instantiating


    e.g: Dog myDog = new Dog("Rex", 4, "german shepherd");

- What is a constructor?
    - The constructor is a special method that gets called when an object is getting instantiated from a class
    (when using the new key word)
    - It will set values that specific object needs to be created
    - It usually setting the fields of a class
    - Every class has a default constructor that also gets called, but it doesn't accepts any values
    - Also you can pass data through there arguments and set the logic in the constructor to do something with it when the class being instantuated
    - A constructor technically builds an object from a class

    e.g: class Dog{
            private final String name;
            private int age;
            private final String breed;

            //constructor
            public Dog(String name, int age, String breed){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.breed = breed;
            }
        }


- What is an `enum` in Java?

    - Enum is a special data type
    - Enums consist of pre-defined values separated by cammas
    - These values are constant values 
    - Because they are constant you should write them with uppercase

    - In the newer version of java you can set fields to the enum
    - In this case the enum values can hold other datas also
    - This is called smart enums


- Explain the difference between a class and an enum.

    - Enums also can hold attributes and methods
    - The difference is that enums values are constants, public, static, finals
    (so you can't change the values and can't hide the constant values)
    - Also you cant instantiate objects from an enum
    - An enum fields are static so you can call them by using it's "class"
    - Enums can't be super or subclasses to another class

    e.g: enum Level {
            LOW,
            MEDIUM,
            HIGH
        }

- Explain the difference between a class and a record.

    - The record is a sintacticalsugar
    - It is working like a class 
    - It can have static fields and method (We don't create them usually)
    - Record helping us by creating the boilerplate code for a class
    - It creates a constructor, getters and also some important overides too like the equals() & hascode() and also the toString()
    - So we only need to pass the data in the brackets and we can access them
    - You can't modifie them

    e.g:  public record Person(String name, int age){}

- What are interfaces? Why should we use them?

    - An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies
    - To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented"
    - Interfaces cannot be used to create objects 
    - Interface methods do not have a body (Interface methods do not have a body)
    - You must override all of its methods in the implementation
    - Interface methods are by default abstract and public
    - Interface cannot contain a constructor

    - Why to use interfaces: - To achieve security
                             - To achive multiple inherritance (you can only inherit one class, but you can implement many interfaces)
                             - To group together related classes


    e.g: interface Animal {
            public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
            public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
        }

        
- What is inheritance?

    - It is one of the core concepts of oop
    - We use it when we have "is-a" relationship between objects
    - It is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes
    - It is transitive (multi level inherritance: Vehicle -> Car -> Sedan | Vehicle is the superclass of Car and Sedan)
    - With inheritance we pass a classe's fields and methods to another class
    - It extends a class with another class 
    - It uses the extends keyword
    - Parent-child hierarchy


    e.g.:   class Sedan extends Car{

            }

    - Benefits: - code reuse (DRY)
                - code reusability
                - reduce code duplication

    - Important ponts: - public and protected (accessmodifiers) fields and method are avaible to the child classes
                       - superclass constructor not inherited by subclasses
                         (You have to call the superclass constructor in the subclasse's costructor)

                         e.g.: class Sedan extends Car{

                                    public Sedan(int doorCount, boolean isRunning){
                                        super(doorCount, isRunning);
                                    }
                               }



                      - Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance
                      - We can use upcasting (We can assign subclasse's instance to superclasse's variable)
                      - We can use downcasting (We can assign superclasse's instance to subclasse's !! Only by explicit casting!! )
                        (It can run into ClassCastException)
                        e.g.: Sedan sedan = new Sedan();
                              Vehicle vehicle = sedan;
                              Sedan sedan2 = (Sedan) vehicle;

                      - We can override the method of Superclass in the Subclass
                      - We can reference superclass methods and fields with the super keyword in the subclass
                      - You can use abstract class to create a class that cannot be instantiated
                        It can be used when you just want to inherit fields and methods to child classes and don't want to use the base class


- Is multiple inheritance allowed in Java?

    - It isn't allowed in Java
    - You can achive simular results with interfaces


- What is a static class member?

    - As a static member, only one copy of the data is maintained for all objects of the class
    - Static members are belongs to the class and not to the object instance
    - You can access these members without object instances (Only with the class)
    - You can create by using the "static" keyword

        private static doorCount;

    - These members are created and initialized when the class is loaded
    - Also there are static blocks (JVM executes these before main method, at the time of class loading)
    
        e.g.: public class MyClass {
                static{
                    System.out.println("Hello this is a static block");
                }
                public static void main(String args[]){
                    System.out.println("This is main method");
                }
              }

- Can a static method use non-static members?

    - Static methods only can access static members of the class
    - You can access static members from non-static methods


- What does the `final` keyword mean in Java?

    - Final means that the specific field won't change uppon running the application
    - You can declare constant variables, values with it

    e.g.: private final static double PI = 3.14;

- What does the `abstract` keyword mean in Java?

    - In the cases of classes it means that cannot be instantiated
    - You can only extend from it and can't create an object from it
    - You can still have implemented methods, fields and constructors that can be inherited

    - In the cases of methods it means it is only a method declaration
    - You have to @Overide it and implement in the subclass

    e.g.: abstract class Animal{
            public abstract void walk();
          }


- What is _overloading_ in Java?

    - It is a type of polimorphism
    - It is compile-time poliymorphism (static polyorphism)
    - Method oveloading is when there are multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters
    - The access modifier, return type and name has to be the same, the parameters has to be different from each other
    - The these creating a method signature, hance when the parameters are different the signature is also different
    - This is how the JVM separates the methods from each other


    e.g.: public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2){
            //implementation
          }

          public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2, int num3){
            //implementation
          }

          public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4){
            //implementation
          }


- What is _overriding_ in Java?

    - It is a type of polimorphism
    - It is run-time poliymorphism (dynamic polyorphism)
    - It is the process when the JVM runs a different implementation of the same method
    - It is used in inheritance and interfaces
    - This change between implementations is decided at run-time
    - Overriding is occures when a derived class has a different implementation of a method that is in the base (super) class
    - It is important at abstract methods and interfaces
    - You have to use the @Override annotation to tell the compiler to throw compile error when something in the base class is changed and stayed the same at the subclass

    e.g.: class Animal{

            public abstract void walk();

          }

          class Dog extends Animal{

            @Override
            public abstract void walk(){
                System.out.println("Dog walking!")
            }

          }



          interface shape{

            public double calculateArea();

          }

          class Square implements shape{

            @Override
            public double calculateArea(){
                //implementation
            }
          }




- What is the difference between overloading and overriding?

    Overloading
    - With overloading you declare the same method with different parameters and signatures
    - It has different implementations at every different signatures
    - It is defided at compilation-time, static polymorphism (Before the program runs)

    Override
    - With overrideing you change the implementation of a method that was in the super class (you change this in the subclass)
    - It used in inheritance and interfaces
    - It is happening in runtime, dynamic polymorphism (It gets decided when the program is running)

- What is `null`?

    - null is a default java value
    - a value that shows that the object is referring to nothing
    - It represents an absents of somethig
    - When the program runs into a null it will throw NullPointerException if it wasn't handeled correctly and stop the program running


- Compare the access modifiers in Java.

    - Default: - don't have any keyword
               - every class method sets as default modifier if you don't specify
               - it is package private (all members are visible within the same package but aren’t accessible from other packages)

               e.g.: void doSomething(){
                        //implementation
                     }

    - Public: - it has "public" keyword
              - it is available to the whole world
              - so every class and every package can access these members
              

              e.g.: public void doSomething(){
                        //implementation
                    }


    - Private: - it has "private" keyword
               - members accessible from the same class only
               - most restrictive access modifier
               - core concept of encapsulation
               - all data will be hidden from the outside world
               - you can only use themembers inside the class

               e.g.: private void doSomethig(){
                        //implementation
                     }


    - Protected: - it has "protected" keyword
                 - between public and private access levels
                 - we can access the members from all subclasses of its class (even if the subclasses are in different packages)
                 - you can access members from there child classes and also from the same package

                 e.g.: protected void doSomething(){
                            //implementation
                       }



- What is the default access modifier in a class?

    - The default access modifier is when you don't declare any access modifier
    - It is package-private access modifier
    - It don't have any keyword


- What is the purpose of the `equals()` method?

    - The java String package has the equals method
    - It compares two string content
    - If the two strings have the same content it will return true, else false
    - It needed, with the default == operator you checking the object and two string objects (instances) will never be the same, because there are stored in a different memory location
    - The String equals() method overrides the equals() method of the Object class.

    e.g.:

    String first = "a";
    String second = "a";

    first.equals(second);   ---> true

- What is the difference between `==` and `equals()`?

    - == signs only compares the memory location of the two objects
    - equals compares the contents of the two objects


- What is the difference between `long` and `Long`?

    - long: - primitive data type
            - it is provided by the language
            - it don't have any methods or provided functionality


    - Long: - it is a class from the java.standard library
            - it serves as a wrapper class for the long data type
            - it is used to provide objects for primitive data types
            - they offer additional methods and utility functions that are not available in the primitive types

    - To decide which one to use, you have to dicide if you need the additional methods of the wrapper class or you just need a number
- Which can store bigger numbers, `long` or `Long`?

    - Both can represent the same amount of numric values
    - long is a 64bit complementer for the standard int
    - Long is just an object representation of the long primitive type
    - Long has the max value method: Long.MAX_VALUE();
    - Long has the min value method: Long.MIN_VALUE();


- What kind of packages do you know under `java.util.*` ? Bring at least 3 examples.

    - It contains the main packages

    - java.util.Collection
    - Datastructure packages: - java.util.Set
                              - java.util.List
                              - java.util.Queue
                              - java.util.HashSet
                              - java.util.ArrayList
                              - java.util.LinkedList


    - java.util.Arrays ---> Wrapper class for the array primitive datastructure
    - java.util.Random
    - java.util.Scaner
    
## Architecture

- Explain the Single Responsibility Principle.

    - Single responsibility is one of the SOLID principles
    - A class should only have one responsibility
    - It should only have one reason to change
    - Benefits: - Easier to write test cases
                - Looser coupling, fewer dependencies
                - Easier readability and maintainability
                - Fewer changes


- Explain the Interface Segregation Principle.

    - Interface Segregation is one of the SOLID principles
    - Larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones.
    - By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.
    - This principle stops you from bloated interfaces with unnecesarry methods
    - It is working together with the Liskov rule
    - With this two rules it stops subclasses implementing unnecessarry methods
    - Benefits: - reduced side effects
                - less frequency of required changes
                - it stops interface pollution

    - “Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”


- What is _composition over inheritance_?

    - Classes should favor polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition over inheritance from a base or parent class
    - Composition: containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality
    - One way to implement composition is by creating interfaces for the functionalities and implementing the needed ones in the class

    - The other way is when creating interfaces and also creating separate classes for the implementation of the functionalities.
    If you want to use this you also have to use dependency inversion principle to pass down the functionalities to the class.
    With this aproach you will have a flexible system

    - With composition you will have loose coupling, and you won't depend uppon concreate implementations


    e.g.: 
    ```java
    interface Engine{
        void startEngine();
    }

    class CombustionEngine implements Engine{
        @Override
        void startEngine(){
            System.out.println("Start CombustionEngine Engine!");
        }
    }


    class Car{
        private final Engine engine;

        public Engine(Engine engine){
            this.engine = engine;
        }

        public void start(){
            engie.startEngine();
        }
    }
    ```


- What is a model class?

    - It is used to model the data in your class
    - It mirrors a thing like a database record, a person's information and holds there data
    - These types of classes mostly used for storing and retreiving data
    - Because of this case we can youse records instead of classes


- What is a service class?

    - It is used to implement some type of service logic for the program
    - It can contains datastructors and models through there constructor
    - It has methods to do some kind of service, functionality
    - It's main role to do something, and hold implementations, functions of a service, logic


- Explain the Open/Closed principle.

    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
    - In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs
    - One exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code
    - It uses inheritance to extend (and interfaces)
    - Benefits: - minimize errors and bugs
                - Easily add new functionalities (By inheriting)
                - Easier testing


- Explain the Liskov Substitution Principle.

    - If class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program
    - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
    - The objects of your subclasses should behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass
    - Overridden method of a subclass needs to accept the same input parameter values as the method of the superclass
    - The return value of a method of the subclass needs to comply with the same rules as the return value of the method of the superclass

    - Benefits: - Increases code reusability

- Explain the Dependency Inversion Principle.

    - Refers to the decoupling of software modules
    - Instead of high-level modules(interfaces, abstraction) depending on low-level modules(concreate implementation), both will depend on abstractions

    - One of the most used method for dependency inversion is dependency-injection
    - High-level modules (which provide complex logic) should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules (which provide utility features)
    - Introduce an abstraction that decouples the high-level and low-level modules from each other
    - Both should depend on abstractions
    - Abstractions should not depend on details 
    - It splits the dependency between the high-level and low-level modules by introducing an abstraction between them
    - Benefits: - Loose coupling between components
                - Improve modularity
                - Maintainability
                - Testability of your code

                

- What do we mean by the Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns? Can you name some of these patterns?

    - The Gang of Four (Gof) Patterns are a group of 23 Design Patterns originally published in a seminal book entitled Design Patterns
    - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
    - The term 'Gang of Four' refers to the four authors (Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson)


- What are the risks associated with using the GoF design patterns?

    - Negative design issues (highly coupled and less cohesive classes)
    - Miss-use of design patterns
    - Ineffective addressing of issues (increasing code complexity or code duplications)
    - High similarity among design patterns


- What do we mean by YAGNI?

    - YAGNI is an acronym for 'You Aren't Gonna Need It' 
    - YAGNI says that only up-to-date stuff should be done and dont implement things that are not needed at the current moment

    
- What do we mean by SLAP?

    - SLAP stands for the Single Level of Abstraction Principle
    - Proposes that code should have a single level of abstraction
    - SLAP promotes code clarity, maintainability, and reusability, functions and modules are focused on completing one task at a time


- What do we mean by KISS?

    - Keep it simple, stupid
    - a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible.
    - a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible.

    
- What is the Repository Pattern?

    - This is a popular designpattern
    - Which is focuses on separating the database logic from the business/service logic
    - It is adding a plus abstract layer that can ahndle databse methods
    - These methods can handle the CRUD operations
    - So the main logic doesn't have to deal with the database connection and other database operations
    - Thanks to this it keeps the Single Responsibility Principle in charge
    - Usually we create a database interface where we clearly declaring the methods that we need to do the CRUD operations on the database


- What is a CRUD interface?


## Unit testing
- Why is unit testing a good practice?

    Improve Quality and Performance
    - Unit tests are small, isolated tests that are used to check specific parts of the code, such as functions or classes
    - Developers can identify and fix problems quickly, before they become larger issues
    - Ensure that the software is of high quality and runs as efficiently as possible
    

    Allows for Documentation
    - Document code and help others understand how it works
    
    Find Bugs
    - Help you to catch regressions early before they cause problems in production
    - Developers can ensure that their code is functioning as expected and that any potential issues have been identified and corrected
    - Reduce the amount of time required for debugging


- What is JUnit?

    - JUnit is a unit testing open-source framework
    - Developers use this framework to write and execute automated tests


- What is a parameterized test?

    - Enables us to execute a single test method multiple times with different parameters
    - Allows you to execute the same test, multiple times using different parameters

- What options do you have in NUnit to create parameterized tests?

    - Inline – As Test Case Attribute
    - Inline – As Random Attribute, Range Attribute, Values Attribute
    - Separate – TestCaseSource Attribute
    - Separate – ValueSource Attribute


- What is _mocking_?

    - An object under test may have dependencies on other
    - To isolate the behaviour of the object you want to test you replace the other objects by mocks
    - Mocks simulate the behaviour of the real objects
    - Mocking is creating objects that simulate the behaviour of real objects


- What is the difference between _mocking_, _stubbing_ and _faking_?

    - Create objects or components that are not real.
    - We need them to simulate the response

    - Faking: - Fakes are objects that have working implementations
              - A fake object implements the same interface as a real object (takes shortcuts)
              - Generally used when we need to test something that depends on an external service or API (don’t want to make actual calls)

              - e.g.: in memory databases


    - Mock: - Mocks are objects that have predefined behavior
            - Don’t have working implementations
            - They have pre-programmed expectations about how they will be used

            - e.g.: A mock object might be programmed to return a specific value when it is called with certain arguments


    - Stub: - Stubs are objects that return predefined values
            - Don’t have working implementations
            - They are not programmed to expect specific calls
            - They return values when they are called

            - e.g.: A stub might be programmed to always return the same value when called with any arguments


## Databases

- What are relational databases? What are their advantages and disadvantages?


    - Relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table
    - Data is typically structured across multiple tables
    - Tables can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key
    - Relational databases are based on the relational model of data
    - System used to maintain are relational database management system (RDBMS)
    - RDBMS are using the SQL (Structured Query Language) language

    - Advantages: - A Relational Database system is the simplest model (it does not require complex structuring or querying processes)
                  - Non-repetitive data (chance for duplication of data, tables can be related with primary or foreign keys)
                  - Easy Access to Data with simple queries to etreive data
                  - Flexibility (no boundary on the number of rows, columns, or tables a relational database can hold)
                  - High Security (users can designate tables as confidential or non-confidential)


    - Disadvantages: - Maintenance Problem (maintenance becomes difficult over time due to the increase in the data)
                     - Cost (cost of the software alone can be quite pricey)
                     - Physical Storage (The requirements of physical memory may increase along with the increase of data)
                     - Complexity in Structure (databases can only store data in tabular form, which makes it difficult to represent relationships)

                     


- How do you associate entities to each other in a relational database model?

    - One of the way by storing the id (primary key) of one table in the other table as a collumn
    - With this approach you can retreave the other data that is related to that record

    - The other way by creating a separate link table where you store both tables id's (primary key)
    - With this approach you can create a more flexible sollution and a cleaner one, but it will get more complex to query a specific data

    - The link table acts like an aggregator table which connect the two separate table together and creating relations between them

- What are tables in a relational database?

    - In relational databases a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns (identifiable by name) and horizontal rows

    - The cell being the unit where a row and column intersect
    - Database objects that contain all the data in a database
    - In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet
    - Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field in the record


- What is a _primary key_?

    - A column in a relational database table that's distinctive for each record
    - It's a unique identifier (driver's license number, telephone number, or an id)
    - A relational database must have only one primary key
    - Every row of data must have a primary key value and none of the rows can be null
    - It's possible to change the primary key for a given database
    - Every entity in a data model should have a primary key
    
    - Benefits: - Helps identify unique data, such as a customer ID
                - Prevents duplication of records in a table
                - Helps with updating or deleting only specific records
                - Helps ensure that fields aren't null
                - Helps set up relationships between tables




- What is a _foreign key_?

    - A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table
    - The table with the foreign key is called the child table
    - The table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table
    - The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column (it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table)


    - Foreign key is a column or columns in a database that are linked to a column in a different table
    - A foreign key column establishes a foreign key constraint (ensures that a value can be added or updated if the same value already exists in another table)

    - Rows will only be added or updated in the child table if the value in the foreign key column of the row being updated matches an existing value in the referenced column of the parent table

    - Foreign keys put the “relational” in “relational database”
    - They help define the relationships between tables


- What does the SQL abbreviation stand for?

    - Structured Query Language


- What are some of the SQL database providers that you’ve heard of?

    - Some of the known SQL database providers: - Oracle,
                                                - MySQL
                                                - PostgreSQL
                                                - SQLite
                                                - Microsoft SQL Server
                                                - IBM Db2


- What are SQL data types? Are there any differences in data types between different SQL databases?

    - Data types might have different names in different database
    - Even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different
    (Check the documentation)

    - Data types in PostgreSQL: - Boolean
                                - CHAR(n) <- fixed length characters
                                - VARCHAR(n) <- Simular to CHAR, not fixed sized
                                - TEXT  <- Variable length string size

                                - Small integer (SMALLINT) <- Max value: 32 767
                                - Integer (INT) <- Max value: 2 147 483 647
                                - Serial (SERIAL) <- Auto incremented integer (for ids)

                                - float(n) <- n precision (maximum of 8-bytes)
                                - real <- 4-byte floating-point numbers
                                
                                - DATE <- Store the dates
                                - TIME <- stores the time
                                - TIMESTAMP <- stores both date and time
                                - TIMESTAMPTZ  <- timezone-aware timestamp
                                - INTERVAL <- store periods of time

                                - Arrays <- can be used to store an array of strings or an array of integers etc

                                - JSON <- stores two types: JSON, JSONB (binary JSON)

                                - UUID <- store Universal Unique Identifiers defined by RFC 4122




- What are _constraints_ in SQL?

    - Constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table
    - Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement
    - After the table is created you can specify with the ALTER TABLE statement
    
    e.g.: CREATE TABLE table_name (
            column1 datatype constraint,
            column2 datatype constraint,
            column3 datatype constraint,
            ....
        );  


    - Used to specify rules for the data in a table
    - Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table
    - Ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table
    - If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted

    - Constraints can be column level or table level

    - Commonly used constraints: - NOT NULL
                                 - UNIQUE
                                 - PRIMARY KEY (A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE, uniquely identifies each row in a table)
                                 - FOREIGN KEY (Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables)
                                 - CHECK (Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition)
                                 - DEFAULT (Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified)
                                 - 

- How can we program different SQL databases in Java?

    - We can program SQL databases by different libraries
    - The most known java library is jdbc (Java Database Connectivity) and the java.sql library
    - Different databases has differetn jdbc dependencies, that you can find on maven Reposetory
    - You have to find the suitable for your database provider
    - With jdbc you can create a conncetion to your database by a connection url

    - The java.sql library has some methods to set up the connection and manage the database
    - We have classes to create connections to the databse: - DriverManager
    - Creating statement: - Statement
                          - PreparedStatement <- you can create a statement with different values in it 
                          - they have an execute method in them

    - Retreveing the data from the database: - you can collect the data with the ResultSet class
                                             - You have to use a while loop with the ResultSet next() method




- Which SQL statement is used to create tables? Describe the syntax briefly.

    - To create a table in SQL : CREATE TABLE table_name(
                                    collumn_name datatype constraints
                                    collumn_name datatype constraints
                                    collumn_name datatype constraints
                                    collumn_name datatype constraints
                                    ...
                                );

    - In this query we specify the table name after the TABLE keyword
    - We can specify the collumns in parenthasis '()'
    - First we have to give the collumn name, after that the datatype and in the end the constraints


- Which SQL statement can be used to insert values? Describe the syntax briefly.

    - To insert data in a table: INSERT INTO table_name (collumn1, collumn2, collumn3, ...)
                                 VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

    - In this query we specify the table that we want to insert data into after the INTO keyword
    - After the table name we can specify the collumns that we want to insert into (This is not needed)
    - After that we use the VALUES keyword and we can give the values in parenthasis that we want to insert
    (If you don't specify the collumns that you want to insert into you have to give every valu that are in the table's collumn section)


- Which SQL statement can be used to update values? Describe the syntax briefly.

    - To update data in a table: UPDATE table_name 
                                 SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
                                 WHERE condition;


    - In this query we specify the table that we would like to update after the UPDATE keyword
    - We can give the specific column the new values after the SET keyword
    - It is important to use the WHERE condition, because if we forget it we are going to change the every record's column value


- Which SQL statement can be used to delete rows?. Describe the syntax briefly.

    - To delete a record/row from a table: DELETE FROM table_name
                                           WHERE CONDITION;


    - We can specify the table that we want to delete from after the DELETE FROM keyword
    - We have to use a WHERE condition to specify which row we would like to delete
    - If we forget the WHERE condition it will delete every record from the table


- Which SQL statement can be used to create queries?. Describe the syntax briefly.

    - To create a query: SELECT column_name/* (everything) FROM table WHERE condition;

    - We have to use the SELECT keyword to specify a get query
    - After that we can specify the column name, if we would like to get every column we can use the * (astrics) symbol
    - After that we can specify from which table we would like to select the datas from
    - After that we can use a WHERE statement to get specific values from the table


- How can you join tables together in SQL? When should you do it?

    - To join tables together: - SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
                                 INNER/LEFT/RIGH/OUTER JOIN table 2
                                 ON table1.foreign_key_column = table2.primary_key_column
                                 WHERE condition;



    - After the regular select query you have to specify the first table with the FROM keyword
    - After that you have to specify the joining type: - INNER (Middle part of the venn dia)
                                                       - LEFT (Left part of the venn diagram)
                                                       - Right (Right part of the venn diagram)
                                                       - The full (Every element of the ven diagram)

    - The most common join is the INNER join
    - After that you have to specify the second table that you want to join the first table with
    - After the ON keyword you have to specify on which column would you like to join together
    - This represents the relationships between the two tables
    - You have to equal the primary key of one table with the foreign key of the other table
    - In the end you can have your regular WHERE condition
