### Waterfall Methodology
* **The history of the waterfall methodology is presented.**  
   * The waterfall model originated in manufacturing and construction industries, and was first adapted to software development by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970.
* **The history of the waterfall methodology in software development is presented.**  
   * It was introduced as a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
* **The different stages of the waterfall methodology are explained.**  
   * The stages include Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance, flowing in one direction like a waterfall.
* **Three disadvantages of the waterfall methodology are presented.**  
   * Limited flexibility, difficulty in accommodating changes, and higher risk of discovering issues late in the process.
* **Two examples of sectors where the waterfall methodology is being used are shown.**  
   * Construction and manufacturing sectors, where strict regulations and clear documentation are essential for project success.

### Kanban Methodology
* **The history of the kanban methodology is presented.**  
   * Kanban originated in Toyotaâ€™s manufacturing system in the 1940s to manage inventory and improve efficiency.
* **The history of the kanban methodology in software development is presented.**  
   * In the late 2000s, Kanban was adapted for software development to enhance project flow and flexibility, focusing on continuous delivery.
* **The kanban cards and the kanban board are briefly explained.**  
   * Kanban cards represent tasks, and the kanban board is a visual tool that shows workflow stages, helping teams track task progress.
* **Three benefits of using the kanban methodology are presented.**  
   * Improved visibility of workflow, reduced bottlenecks, and flexibility in adapting to changes.
* **Two examples of sectors where the kanban methodology is being used are shown.**  
   * Software development and IT support teams, as well as retail inventory management.

### SCRUM Roles
* **The three SCRUM roles are mentioned.**  
   * Product Owner, SCRUM Master, and Development Team.
* **The responsibilities of each SCRUM role are explained in detail.**  
   * Product Owner defines the project vision and backlog; SCRUM Master facilitates the process and removes blockers; Development Team executes the work.
* **Three benefits of using the SCRUM methodology are explained.**  
   * Greater team collaboration, faster delivery through sprints, and adaptability to changes.
* **A reason why using SCRUM could be beneficial in a company is provided.**  
   * SCRUM allows teams to be more responsive to customer feedback and rapidly changing project requirements.

### SCRUM Ceremonies
* **The five different SCRUM ceremonies are mentioned.**  
   * Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Backlog Refinement.
* **Each SCRUM ceremony is explained in detail.**  
   * Sprint Planning defines tasks for the upcoming sprint;
   * Daily Stand-up checks progress;
   * Sprint Review showcases work done;
   * Sprint Retrospective identifies improvements;
   * Backlog Refinement prepares future work.
* **An explanation of which one SCRUM ceremony could be removed to improve it is presented.**  
   * Daily Stand-ups are sometimes unnecessary because they can take up too much time, especially in small teams or when there's little progress to report.
* **An explanation of which one SCRUM ceremony could be added to improve it is presented.**  
   * A team bonding session could be added to build better rapport and improve team dynamics.

### SCRUM User Stories
* **The given concept is explained.**  
   * A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end user.
* **The concept of estimation points is explained.**  
   * Estimation points quantify the effort required for a user story, often using the Fibonacci sequence for sizing.
* **One example of a point estimation system for SCRUM user stories is presented.**  
   * Planning Poker is a popular system where team members assign points based on complexity.
* **The SCRUM user story template is explained.**  
   * A common template is: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [reason]."
* **One example of a SCRUM story template is presented.**  
   * "As a customer, I want to receive notifications so that I stay updated on order status."
* **The SCRUM acceptance criteria is explained.**  
   * Acceptance criteria are conditions that must be met for the story to be marked as complete.
* **One example of an acceptance criteria for the previous user story template is presented.**  
   * Notifications must be sent via email and SMS, and include order status and delivery date.

### SCRUM Board
* **The given concept is explained.**  
   * A SCRUM board visualizes tasks for the sprint and helps track their progress from "To Do" to "Done."
* **A suggestion for five column names for a SCRUM board is provided.**  
   * To Do, In Progress, Code Review, Testing, Done.
* **An explanation of how to move and organize stories in a SCRUM board is provided.**  
   * Stories move across columns as work progresses, starting from To Do and advancing through each stage until Done.
* **The term SCRUM sprint is explained.**  
   * A sprint is a time-boxed iteration (usually 1-4 weeks) where specific tasks are completed.
* **The term SCRUM velocity is explained.**  
   * Velocity is the measure of work completed during a sprint, helping teams estimate future work capacity.
* **Some benefits of using a board to organize tasks are presented.**  
   * Visual tracking improves team collaboration, makes progress visible, and identifies bottlenecks early.
